# unofficial-talonvoice-docs

Documenting my learning experiences with Talon, the speech-to-text system.

## Intro

Talon is a next-generation speech-to-text system for coding, commanding, and dictating to a computer. It is currently in open beta and is under active development by its lead developer, Ryan Hileman, as of April 2018.

Talon provides very good recognition and a still-developing set of APIs for extending it and adding commands. Current versions require the use of [Dragon Naturally Speaking](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html) and Mac OS X at this time. The Talon project also includes support for the [Tobii 4C](http://a.co/bILYudx) eye tracker, which can allow the replacement of a mouse.

These docs aim to provide a quick documentation experience on the use of various APIs, best practices, and example extensions and commands.
