# Using Talon (voice)

First, install both [Talon beta](https://talonvoice.com/) (free) and [Dragon Naturally Speaking](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html) (not free).

Once installed, open both Talon and Dragon Naturally Speaking. On macOS, it should be straight-forward to open these both via Spotlight search or opening the apps directly from the Applications folder.

Make sure that the microphone mode for Dragon is set to "Sleep" mode (blue with moon icon), not Active or Disabled. In this mode, Dragon is only listening for its microphone activation phrase, which is normally `ðŸ”Š wake up`.

**Warning: Avoid saying `ðŸ”Š wake up` when using Talon to avoid enabling Dragon Naturally Speaking dictation.**

When Talon starts, it will use system notifications to indicate when both the eye tracking and voice recognition systems are ready, or whether a system is unable to start and why.

From here, speak into the microphone to enter data, execute [Actions](Actions.md), and perform other tasks. The available [Commands](Commands.md) will be determined by what User Scripts are installed. Read the [User Scripts Overview](UserScriptOverview.md) to learn how to add User Scripts to Talon.
